Learning python, baby steps.  A philosophical port from my Ruby rps.

Items to do:
Get an input
figure out python equivalent to chomp.upcase
define an array of valid inputs (RPS)
Figure out random (random.randint?)
match random to array (like 0=R,1=P,S=2) for computer guess
define function for rps rules
match user input to computer guess to see who wins!

possible bumps:
python 2.x or python 3?
